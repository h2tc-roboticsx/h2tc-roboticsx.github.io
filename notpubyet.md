The dataset is currently under review and, as a result, is not accessible to external users. We are committed to releasing the complete dataset immediately upon acceptance. 

However, we do provide a selection of [sample cases](https://h2tc-roboticsx.github.io/dataset/#sample-cases) that showcase the content of human-human throw&catch activities featured in the dataset. The sample cases are available in Dropbox <a href ="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dghb9k4w4w938q0/AAAMIjWBbzy290QI_Nljocqda?dl=0"><img decoding="async" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2tc-roboticsx/h2tc-roboticsx.github.io/main/assets/images/buttons/download_small.png"  width=20></a>.
